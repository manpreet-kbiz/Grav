    archetype: 'Electrical Engineer'
    managernotes: '<p>Hours: 8-5, 1st shift</p><p>ï»¿We are looking to add a Controls Engineer to our Seattle, WA office (contract to hire).  This person will initially work on a local project using Allen Bradley PLCs so they need to be strong with programming Rockwell.  Ideally, we''d like to find someone who has skills in other PLCs as well.  The initial project will be roughly 3-4 months and assuming they are successful, we will keep them on the team and eventually bring them onto internal staff.  Although they will work locally for the first several months, they also need to be open to travel.  Our Seattle office doesn''t travel quite as frequently as our other offices, but they should at least expect 25-50%.  There are no expenses for local work in Seattle, so they need to be based in the Seattle area.  We want someone mid to senior level who can step in with no additional training.  Hoping to get someone started by mid Feb.</p>'
