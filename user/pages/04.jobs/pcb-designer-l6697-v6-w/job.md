    managernotes: "<p>RR 12/7</p><p>﻿The amount of actual PCB work really varies with what we are working on. Sometimes it is 100% PCB work, sometimes it is only 5%. We need someone that can be happy going with the flow and eager to take on a variety of jobs in this role. We are listing this as a PCB Designer position because that is the skillset that is hardest to get up to speed on, but this could accurately be described as a general engineering position with a focus on PCB work. We basically need a mechanical engineer, an electronic engineer and a PCB engineer in one position. There isn’t enough work to fill each of those specialties separately, but the right candidate with a varied skillset will find plenty of work. We don’t need an expert with degrees in each engineering discipline. We just need someone with some PCB experience that knows enough about the other disciplines to be teachable and, perhaps most importantly, really wants to be involved in the other aspects of the job.</p><p>Hours: 8 - 5</p>\n<p>On Site</p>"
