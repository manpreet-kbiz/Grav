<p>When looking for a Scrum Master with experience working on large, complex, enterprise projects, it's important to seek out candidates who can demonstrate specific examples of such projects. Consider candidates who have experience working in industries known for developing complex enterprise applications, such as healthcare, finance, retail, or technology.</p>
<p>Candidates who have experience working in western cultures and who have a good understanding of western business practices and communication styles may also be beneficial. Strong communication skills, both verbal and written, are essential, as is the ability to manage project scope, timeline, and budget, and to keep stakeholders informed and engaged.</p>
<p>Consider candidates who have experience managing multiple agile teams and who can ensure alignment across teams. Finally, seek out candidates who have experience with the latest technologies and practices relevant to enterprise application development and who have received positive feedback and references from previous employers or clients regarding their experience working on large, complex enterprise projects as a Scrum Master.﻿</p>";s:12:"prescreenurl";s:131:"<p>Pipeline Scrum Master:&nbsp;﻿<a href="https://app.willotalent.com/invite/Mmx7Cj/">https://app.willotalent.com/in...</a>﻿</p>";s:15:"payrateguidance";s:0:"";s:15:"submissionnotes";s:56:"<p>Level 2 - $95 - $110</p>
