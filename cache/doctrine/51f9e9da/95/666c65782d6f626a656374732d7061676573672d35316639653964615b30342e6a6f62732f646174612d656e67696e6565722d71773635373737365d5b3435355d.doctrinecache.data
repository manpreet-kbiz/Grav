<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-style-cache="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-span="true">﻿Data Pipeline:</span></strong></p>
<p>﻿A data pipeline is a series of steps that data goes through in order to be processed, transformed, and analyzed. Data pipelines typically involve a series of tools and technologies that work together to move data from its original source, through various processing steps, and finally to its destination where it can be analyzed and used for insights.</p>
<ol><li>E-commerce Data Pipeline: This data pipeline involves processing data from multiple sources, such as customer orders, website clicks, and inventory data. The pipeline includes steps such as data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading into a data warehouse. This pipeline can be used to analyze customer behavior, track inventory levels, and optimize pricing strategies.</li><li>IoT Data Pipeline: This data pipeline involves processing data from sensors and other devices connected to the internet of things (IoT). The pipeline includes steps such as data ingestion, filtering, aggregation, and storage in a data lake. This pipeline can be used to analyze machine performance, detect anomalies, and predict maintenance needs.</li><li>Social Media Data Pipeline: This data pipeline involves processing data from social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The pipeline includes steps such as data extraction, transformation, and loading into a data warehouse. This pipeline can be used to analyze social media trends, track customer sentiment, and optimize marketing strategies.</li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-style-cache="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-span="true">Azure Data Factory:</span></strong></p>
<p>Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service that allows businesses to create, schedule, and manage data pipelines that move and transform data from various sources to various destinations.</p>
<ol><li>Data Migration: ADF can be used to move data from an on-premises data center to a cloud-based data warehouse, such as Azure Synapse Analytics. This can be useful for businesses that want to migrate their data to the cloud for increased scalability, security, and accessibility.</li><li>Data Integration: ADF can be used to integrate data from multiple sources, such as databases, file systems, and SaaS applications. For example, ADF can be used to extract data from a SQL Server database, transform it, and load it into a Salesforce CRM system.</li><li>Big Data Processing: ADF can be used to create data pipelines that process large amounts of data using tools such as Azure Databricks or HDInsight. This can be useful for businesses that need to analyze large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.</li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-style-cache="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-span="true">Spark:</span></strong></p>
<ul><li>Spark is a tool that helps to process and analyze large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. Think of it as a super-fast calculator that can do complex calculations on large sets of data in a very short amount of time.</li><li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.875rem;" data-redactor-span="true" data-redactor-style-cache="font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.875rem;">For example, let's say you have a large amount of customer data that you want to analyze to find out what products your customers are most interested in. Spark can help you process this data quickly and extract the insights you need to make informed business decisions.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.875rem;" data-redactor-span="true" data-redactor-style-cache="font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.875rem;">After data has been transformed and processed using Spark, it can be stored in a data warehouse or other storage system, where it can be analyzed further using business intelligence tools like Tableau or Power BI. Spark can also be used for machine learning, allowing businesses to build models that can be used to make predictions and optimize operations.</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-style-cache="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-span="true">﻿Databricks:</span></strong></p>
<p>﻿﻿While Spark is a powerful distributed computing engine designed for processing and analyzing large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, Databricks provides a range of additional features and capabilities that make it easier to use and more powerful.</p>
<p>Some key features of Databricks include:</p>
<ol><li>Unified Workspace: Databricks provides a unified workspace for data engineers, data scientists, and business analysts to collaborate and work with data using Spark.</li><li>Notebooks: Databricks provides a notebook interface that allows users to write and execute code in a collaborative environment. Notebooks can be used for data exploration, data cleaning, and machine learning tasks.</li><li>Machine Learning Capabilities: Databricks provides machine learning libraries and tools that can be used to build and deploy machine learning models.</li></ol>
<p><strong><span data-redactor-style-cache="font-size: 16px;" data-redactor-span="true" style="font-size: 16px;">Data Modeling:</span></strong>﻿</p><ul><li>Think of it like building a blueprint for a house. Before construction can begin, an architect must create a detailed plan that outlines the different rooms, hallways, and features of the house. Similarly, in data modeling, an analyst or developer must create a blueprint for a database that shows how different pieces of data relate to one another and how they can be organized.</li><li>Data modeling involves identifying the different entities, or objects, that will be stored in the database and defining the relationships between them. For example, if building a database for an online retailer, the entities might include customers, orders, and products, with relationships defined between them. The model will also specify the data types and constraints for each attribute, such as whether a field is required or optional.</li><li>The resulting data model serves as a guide for developers as they build the actual database. It can help ensure that the data is organized in a logical and efficient manner, and that it is consistent with the business requirements. It can also make it easier to modify the database later on if needed.</li><li>In summary, data modeling is the process of creating a blueprint for a database that outlines how different pieces of data relate to one another. This helps developers create a well-organized and efficient database that aligns with business requirements.</li></ul><p><br><br></p>";s:12:"prescreenurl";s:144:"<p>Pipeline:&nbsp;﻿Data Engineer:&nbsp;﻿﻿<a href="https://app.willotalent.com/invite/onIV2D/">https://app.willotalent.com/in...</a>﻿</p>";s:15:"payrateguidance";s:48:"<p>Level 2 - $65-$70</p><p>Level 3 - $70-$75</p>";s:15:"submissionnotes";s:13:"<p>95-125</p>";s:23:"skillchallengequestions";s:289:"<p><a href="https://gentissolutions.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/recruiters/Ea57z4ofd4VKjax6OMkByfcBxQGq59qa20LXSPHNmcq8Qw?e=JWLAnx"><a href="https://gentissolutions.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/recruiters/Ea57z4ofd4VKjax6OMkByfcBxQGq59qa20LXSPHNmcq8Qw?e=ZanKL6">Azure Data Engineer.docx</a>﻿</a>﻿</p>";}s:8:"taxonomy";a:2:{s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;s:4:"jobs";i:1;s:0:"";}s:3:"tag";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}}}s:11:"frontmatter";s:12993:"title: 'Data Engineer'
